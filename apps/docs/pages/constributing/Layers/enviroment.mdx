# Enviroment

The Enviroment layers is top layer of the Github Repo.<br/> This is maintained by TurboRepo and is used to manage the
enviroment of the project.<br/>

Our MonoRepo is managed by TurboRepo. To learn more about TurboRepo, visit
[TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook). We gonna here partly explain how we use TurboRepo in our project
and link to official documentation.

    ## Package manager
    We use [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/) as our package manager.

    What is [`pnpm`](https://pnpm.io/)?
    pnpm is a fast and efficient package manager caching and reusing downloaded before packages.

    ### Commands
    | npm command   | pnpm equivalent |
    | ---           | ---             |
    | `npm install`   | `pnpm install`    |
    | `npm i <pkg>`   | `pnpm add <pkg>`  |
    | `npm run <cmd>` | `pnpm <cmd>`     |
    [Source of table](https://pnpm.io/pnpm-cli#commands)

    You can check out the [pnpm docs](https://pnpm.io/) for more information.<br/>
    [Cursor.so](https://cursor.sh/) with builded-in AI will help you induring developing using in bash AI prompts.



    ## Workspaces
    Workspaces are separated repositiores which can share sources with each other.<br/>
    Every of workspace has his own `package.json` file and need to install dependencies separately.

    Every of workspace must have unique name and can be accessed by `@<workspace-name>`.
    To Add workspace to project, you need to add it to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` file.

    Example:

    ```yaml copy
        packages:
            - "apps/*"
            - "config/*"
            - "packages/*"
    ```
    You can add empty workspace by `turbo gen` too:<br/>
    (More about `turbo gen` at [TurboRepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/generators) and below
    ```bash copy
        turbo gen workspace --name <workspace-name>
    ```

    More about workspaces at [TurboRepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/workspaces)


    This is how we solve sharing configs and code between projects - We declared folders in `config` as workspaces in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

    ## Install Dependencies
    Installing dependencies in a monorepo is a bit different than a regular repo.<br/>
    In [TurboRepo](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/package-installation) you install in the same way like at `pnpm` with one difference, you have to use flag `--filter` to define in which workspace you want to install it.

    ```bash copy
        pnpm add <package-name> --filter <workspace-name>
    ```
    or

    ```bash copy
        pnpm remove <package-name> --filter <workspace-name>
    ```
    More about Filtering at [TurboRepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/filtering)

        ### Installing/Sharing workspaces
        To install workspace in another workspace, you need to use command.<br/>

        `apps/docs/package.json`

        ```json copy
        {
            "dependencies": {
                "packages": "workspace:*"
            }
        }
        ```
        More about sharing workspaces at [TurboRepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/workspaces#workspaces-which-depend-on-each-other)

        ### Dependencies vs devDependencies vs peerDependencies
        Dependencies are packages that are required for the project to run.<br/>
        devDependencies are packages that are required for the project to run in development.<br/>
        peerDependencies are packages that are required for the project to run in production.<br/>

        |                   | Required to run   | to run in development  | to run in production |
        |   ---             | ---               | ---                    | ---                  |
        | Dependencies      | ✔️               | ❌                    | ❌                   |
        | devDependencies   | ❌               | ✔️                    | ❌                   |
        | peerDependencies  | ❌               | ❌                    | ✔️                   |

    ## Scripts `package.json`
    Scripts are commands that you can run in your terminal to execute a specific task stored at `package.json`.<br/>
    With TurboRepo you can run scripts at all workspaces at once using `turbo` .<br/>

    So you dont have to go to every workspace and run the same command.<br/>

    ```bash copy
        turbo pnpm dev
    ```
    runs `dev` script at every workspace.
    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
        To run scripts at every workspace, you need to have the same script at `package.json` every workspace.
        If one of Workspaces doesnt have the script, it will ignore it.
    </Callout>

    More about scripts at [TurboRepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/dev)

        ### Our `package.json` scripts
        There we will explain how we use scripts at our project.
        `package.json`

        ```json
            SCRIPTS.JSON - Add later
        ```


    ## Code Generation
    TurboRepo has builded-in generators and custom generator (plop).<br/>
    You can generate/copy workspace

    Add empty workspace:

    ```bash copy
        turbo gen workspace --name <workspace-name>
    ```

    Copy workspace:

    ```bash copy
        turbo gen workspace --copy --name <workspace-name-to-copy>
    ```
    Examples from [TurboRepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/code-generation#examples)

        ### Custom Generators
        It's one of the most important features of TurboRepo - [plop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/plop) (It's not TurboRepo own package, its implemented).<br/>
        With custom generators you can generate files/folders from templates.<br/>
        It helps us to make standards and improve. <br/>
        <Callout>
            Note: While Turborepo Generators are built on top of Plop, they do not require plop to be installed as a dependency in your repo.
        </Callout>

        More about writing custom generators at [TurboRepo docs](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/monorepos/code-generation#writing-generators)

    ## ChangeLogs
    After every change, you need to update changelog.<br/>
    We use `ChangeSet` to generate changelogs.<br/>
    More about `ChangeSet` at [They Docs](https://github.com/changesets/changesets#documentation)
    More about creating ChangeLogs at our [Docs](/constributing/Layers/enviroment#changelogs)

    ## .Github
    In `.github` folder we store all github related files (Configs and templates).<br/>

    ### Github Issues Template
    We use Github Issues Template to make sure that every issue has all needed information.<br/>
    It's also helps us to make sure that every issue is in the right place.<br/>

    You can find them at `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE` folder.<br/>

    More about Github Issues Template at [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue-template-for-your-repository)

        ### .githubignore
        To do not push files to github repo, we use `.githubignore` file.<br/>
        Use it to block files which are installed by package managers, caches, logs or super secrets.<br/>

        ### Github hooks
        We use Github hooks to automate our workflow (pre-commit for example).<br/>

        ### Github Actions (CI/CD)
        We use Github Actions to automate our workflow.<br/>
        It's our final tester,builder and deployer.<br/>

        On github you can see that last commit passed all tests and was deployed or not.<br/>
        It's last and most important step of our workflow because if did not pass commit it not gonna be merged.<br/>

        You can find them at `.github/workflows` folder.<br/>

        More about Github Actions at [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions)

        ### Github Pull Request Template
        We use Github Pull Request Template to make sure that every pull request has all needed information.<br/>
        It's also helps us to make sure that every pull request is in the right place.<br/>

        You can find them at `.github/pull_request_template.md`<br/>

        More about Github Pull Request Template at [Github Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)

    ## Eslint (Linter)
    We use Eslint to lint our code (Detect code errors and style problems).<br/>
    It's helps us to make sure that our code is clean and readable.<br/>

    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
        With Every Eslint rule change you have to update whole project to pass pre-commit, so start on [Github Discuss]() to be sure that's worth.
    </Callout>

    We use [Flat Config]() to configure Eslint.<br/>

    Eslint basicly works only with JS, we did install extra plugins for additional rules which can lint TS, YML, JSX and more.
        ### Recommendation
        We recommend to read Eslint Rules, check how we configure our config with his rules and plugins and in full understanding start coding.

        ### Flat config viewer
        Best way to edit Eslint rules is to use [eslint-flat-config-viewer](https://github.com/antfu/eslint-flat-config-viewer). <br/>
        It's amazing tool which helps you to supervise which plugins are use in, which rules are used,deprecated and how setted <br/>

        To start Server
        ```bash copy
        npx eslint-flat-config-viewer
        ```

        ### Plugins we use
        - [typescript-eslint]() - Lint TS
        - [Stylistic]() - Lint code style
        - [eslint-plugin-optimize-regex]() - Optimize regex
        - [eslint-plugin-pii]() - Remove every secret data like emails,tokens etc
        - [eslint-plugin-security]() - Protect from security issues
        - [eslint-plugin-xss]() - Protect from XSS
        - [eslint-plugin-yml]() - Lint YML
        - [eslint-plugin-mdx]() - Lint JSX

    ## Husky (Github Hooks handler)
    We use Husky to handle Github Hooks.<br/>

    To edit Husky you have to go to `.husky` folder.<br/>

        ### Precommit
        We use precommit to run tests and lint code before every commit to be sure everything is okay.<br/>

    ## Lint-staged (Automated scripts process)
    We use lint-staged to run scripts in the right order before precommit.<br/>
    His config you can find in `package.json`

    ## Prettier (Code formatter)
    We use Prettier to format our code, make it same format at all files in Repo.<br/>
    His config you can find in `package.json` file.<br/>
    Ignored files to format are in `.prettierignore` file.<br/>
    <Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
        Dont forget! Prettier is not a linter, it's only formatter and it have to obey linter rules.
        Recommend to not to change.
    </Callout>
