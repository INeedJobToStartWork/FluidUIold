# Docs

The Docs layer is the documentation of the project. <br/> This is the place where you can find all the information about
the project.<br/> You can't forget about updating the docs, when you change something in the project (if it's required).

## About

Our Docs are builded on [Nextra](https://nextra.site/) with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/docs/)

Nextra is using [Next.js]() with Page routes. All docs are in the `pages` folder and has been.

We recommend to react Nextra docs before you start writing your own docs - They are very short and clean. <br/>

## Rules of Docs

- Every section of the docs should have a template.
- Should be written in English first.
- Short and clear.

## Templates

All sections of the docs should have a template. <br/> That helps readers to understand the structure of the docs and
find the information they need.

Every template are menaged by [plop](https://plopjs.com/). <br/>

## I18N

Internationalization is a very important part of the project. <br/> Project should target as many people as possible.

<br />

Currently we are supporting only English language, but we are planning to add more languages in the future (Probably at
1.0.0 version). <br/>
