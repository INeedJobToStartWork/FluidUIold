# Welcome future Constributor!

We're happy to have you here! This page will explain how our project works and how you can constribute with it.

    ## Constributing to FluidUI
    Constributing to FluidUI is easy! You can choose to help us in many ways at many levels.
    We are opened for any kind of help, so we decided to introduce people to our project at Roles of Contributors section.


    ## Roles of Contributors
    Are you a **programmer**? maybe a **designer**? or just specific in **other field**? <br/>
    It's not a problem! <br/><br/>
    You are free to choose any role you want. <br/>
    We have divided contributors into roles to make it easier to focus on a specific aspect of the project.

    </Cards>

    ## Core Concepts
    We have a few core concepts that we follow when developing FluidUI. These concepts are the foundation of the project and are important to understand when contributing to FluidUI.

    - Changing - Documenting, Everything should be documented in the way where is easy to understand for everyone.
    - Social Friendly - No Racism, Sexism, etc. [Code_of_Conduct](https://youtube.com) explains it.
    - Easy to use/understand - FluidUI should be easy to use for everyone.

    ## Where to contribute?
    - All things directly related to the project are only on Github.<br/>
    - All things around the project are on Discord, we created special layer for it - `Social`.
