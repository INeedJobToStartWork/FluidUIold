# Commiting

Commiting is one of last steps before we push our code to the repository. Our Commit process is divided into few steps:

How to execute commiting process?

```bash copy
   pnpm comm
   git push
```

<Steps>
  ### Automate use Scripts (lint-staged) Automate our process of commiting. Passing every step of our commiting process.
  ### Linter (Eslint) Checking our code for detect errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. ### ###
  Formatter (Prettier) Formatting our code to be more readable - in one style at our repo. ### Changelogs (ChangeSet)
  Documenting every changes in our project. ### Commit Description (Commitzen) Documenting every changes in our project.
  ### Github Hooker Handler (Husky) If every step of our commiting process is passed, Husky gonna commit our code.
</Steps>

More about configuration of our commiting process you can find at [Environment](/constributing/Layers/enviroment)) page.

## How to properly commit?

In this section you can find some information about how to properly commit your code.

### First Step - Linter (Eslint)

Linters are tools that analyze source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious
constructs. It's the hardest and the most important step of our commiting process.

induring coding process, we should use linter to check our code for errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious
constructs.

<Tabs items={["lint", "lint:fix"]}>
  Detect errors etc.
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash copy pnpm lint ```</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>Linter can also fix some of our errors. ```bash copy pnpm lint:fix ```</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

More about linter you can find at [Environment](/constributing/Layers/enviroment#eslint-linter) page.

### Second Step - Formatter (Prettier)

As formatter we use Prettier.

```bash copy
    pnpm format
```

More about formatter you can find at [Environment](/constributing/Layers/enviroment#prettier-code-formatter) page.

### Third Step - Changelogs (ChangeSet)

Our Changelogs are handled by ChangeSet, changelogs should be created before every change, not only commit.

    ##### Types of commits
    Commit message should be structured as follows:

    - `feat` - A new feature
    - `fix` - A bug fix
    - `docs` - Documentation only changes
    - `style` - Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
    - `refactor` - A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `perf` - A code change that improves performance
    - `test` - Adding missing tests
    - `chore` - Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation

    <Steps>
        #### Add Changes
        ```bash copy
            pnpm changeset
        ```
        #### Generate Tags
        ```bash copy
            pnpm changeset tags
        ```
        #### Add Changes
        ```bash copy
            pnpm changeset publish
        ```
    </Steps>

### Fourth Step - Commitzen

Commitzen is a tool that helps us to create a commit message with prebuilded types.

```bash copy
    pnpm commitizen
```

### Fiveth Step - Github Hooker Handler (Husky)

Commiting it's last step of our commiting process. Right now we `lint-stage` gonna check passing all of our steps.

**To Commit**

```bash copy
    pnpm commit
```

scope - is optional. It's a name of the feature which you are working on.
