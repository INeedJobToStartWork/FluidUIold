Issues, Pull requests and more, in this section you can find how to use them.

    ## Discussion

    Each channel has its own purpose, so make sure you are posting in the right channel.


    ## Issues
    There you can find all of the issues that are related to the project.

    ## Labels
    To find content easier, you can use labels.

    We created special labels starting with `type:` to make it easier to find content by [layers of the project](/constributing/Layers).
